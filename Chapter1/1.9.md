创建中转数据
[CreatStatementData](CreatStatementData.swift)

生成订单
[Statement.swift](Statement.swift)

运行测试:

```Swift
let plays = [
    Play(playID: "hamlet", name: "Hamlet", type: "tragedy"),
    Play(playID: "as-like", name: "As You Like It", type: "comedy"),
    Play(playID: "othello", name: "Othello", type: "tragedy")
]

// 创建Show对象数组
let performances = [
    Show(playID: "hamlet", audience: 55),
    Show(playID: "as-like", audience: 35),
    Show(playID: "othello", audience: 40)
]

let playDictionary = Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues: plays.map { ($0.playID, $0) })

// 创建Invoice对象
let invoice = Invoice(customer: "BigCo", performances: performances)

let result = statement(playDictionary: playDictionary, invoice: invoice)

print(result)
```

结果

> Statement for BigCo
> Hamlet: 650.00 (55 seats)
> As You Like It: 580.00 (35 seats)
> Othello: 500.00 (40 seats)
> Amount owed is 1730.00
> You earned 47 credits
